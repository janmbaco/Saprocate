# Saprocate
## Multicurrency BlockChain 

Today the world of decentralized blockchains focus on providing a currency that, lacking a clear source of that currency, compromises its integrity to a centralized capitalist system. Where far from simply being a fair currency for internet exchange, it is offered to the most embarrassing speculation. 

Saprocate, pronunced saprō'catē, is a blockchain where every user of this system must have at least one RSA key pair, the sign with private signature of those keys is like a currency in the system. Coins, as if manufactured, are given one at a time by signing on another user's public key. The exchange of currencies between user will be done by signing the received transactions and the public key of the target user. The system will thus understand that the holder of these coins is now another user.
