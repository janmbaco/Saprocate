## Multicurrency BlockChain 

Nowaday, the world of decentralized blockchains focus on providing a currency that, lacking a clear origin, compromises its integrity to a centralized capitalist system. Where, the blockchains, far from simply be a fair currency for internet exchange, it is offered to the most embarrassing speculation. 

Saprocate, pronunced saprō'catē, is a blockchain where every user has its own currency. The coins are given one by one by the origin (the user that had created the currency) with a purpose and a expiration date. The users can exchange this coins between other users like they prefere. When the coin go back to the origin, it will fulfill its purpose.
