# Saprocate
## Multicurrency BlockChain 

Nowaday,  the world of decentralized blockchains focus on providing a currency that, lacking a clear origin, compromises its integrity to a centralized capitalist system. Where, the blockchains, far from simply be a fair currency for internet exchange, it is offered to the most embarrassing speculation. 

Saprocate, pronunced saprō'catē, is a blockchain where every user of this system must have at least one RSA key pair, the sign with private signature of those keys is like a currency in the system. Coins, as if manufactured, are given one at a time by signing on another user's public key. 

The user can exchange this coins signing the recevied transaction and de destiny (the hash of the public key of other user). The system will thus understand that the holder of these coins is now another user.

Every coin has to be given with a purpose, by thus every coin has a expiration date.
